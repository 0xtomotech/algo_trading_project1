Each notebook is focused on a specific strategy, offering insights, methodologies, and Python code to explore and implement the concepts. For educational purposes only, not financial advice.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index Fund

The S&P 500 is the world's most popular stock market index. The largest fund that is benchmarked to this index is the SPDR® S&P 500® ETF Trust. It has more than US$250 billion of assets under management. This notebook provides an introduction to the concept of an Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index Fund, highlighting its significance and approach.

### 2. Quantitative Momentum Strategy

"Momentum investing" means investing in the stocks that have increased in price the most. This strategy focuses on capturing the continuation of existing trends in the market. The notebook outlines the methodology to identify and invest in such stocks, demonstrating the potential benefits and risks of momentum investing.
